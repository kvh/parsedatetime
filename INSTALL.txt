parsedatetime uses a standard setup.py install method:

    python setup.py install
    
This will install parsedatetime into your python's site-packages
location and make it available for import'ing

NOTE: parsedatetime's setup.py uses Setuptools ez_setup.py and as
      such will attempt to contact the Python Package Index site
      to see if a new version of Setuptools is required (or to
      download if you don't have it installed.)

parsedatetime is a pure python module so it does not require any
compiler build step.

parsedatetime does not depend on any external library/module but
will use the following if available:

    Setuptools
    PyICU (which depends on ICU)
